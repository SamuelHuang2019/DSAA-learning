# RE: Do we have any faster way for fibonacci sequence than recursion

The answer is **YES**

Recursion is just the raw definition of Fibonacci sequence, however we can find out the general formula for it.

The procedure seems complicated, and the final result is

$$
F_n =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}
\left[
\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n -
\left(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n
\right]
$$

(LaTex formula may looks bad on Blackboard)
